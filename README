The purpose of making this library is to provide a set of (high performance and high reliable)
APIs to help people to operate the STM32F10x series of MCUs more easily and more quickly.

Some of the new features of the ARM Cortex M3, such as bitbend, are used in the library to im-
prove performance of the code.
